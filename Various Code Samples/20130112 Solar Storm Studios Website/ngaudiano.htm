<!--Autobiograghy--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
								
								<p style="margin: 12px; text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"><font size="3">I grew up in Hazleton, Pennsylvania 
								where I graduated from high school in 2000. Always an honor student and band geek. 
								After high school I attended East Stroudsburg University for music. 
								After a year of that I decided I didn't want to be a music teacher so I dropped out. 
								I took a little time off, then I went back to school for electronics engineering technology at Lincoln Technical Institute.</font><br></p>

								<p style="margin: 12px; text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"><font size="3">After I finished my education I didn't know what to do. 
								I had a couple of boring jobs, nothing to do with electronics or music. Bar tended for a little bit. 
								Finally I got a job in electronics where I still am today.</font><br></p>

								<p style="margin: 12px; text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"><font size="3">Ever since I was a little kid I was interested in music. 
								My grandmother had an old Hammond organ that I fooled around with every time I was there. I started playing instruments at a young age. 
								I took piano and organ lessons. I had trumpet all throughout my school years. I also did chorus. 
								Junior high was when I really got interested in playing every instrument I could get my hands on. 
								I learned baritone, tuba, french horn, and cornet, messed around with the violin, learned the reeds and flutes, and started learning percussion. 
								I learned everything I possibly could about music theory and started listening to every type of music there was. 
								This is also the time when I started messing around with the guitar and bass. 
								I got to high school and took some music technology courses for learning the recording arts. 
								I've played keyboards and bass in a few bands. We even recorded a demo. Also messed around and made a few custom guitar pedals and a Theremin. 
								In the end the band thing didn't work out. I got married and started a family. 
								I didn't really do much in music for a few years until this whole crazy company thing was mentioned. 
								This was probably the best chance I was going to have to get back to my music and my creative side. 
								They asked me to be CMO of Solar Storm Studios, LLC. I accepted and this where I am. 
								I hope I could make the whole experience you have an enjoyable one with the music. 
								Maybe inspire a few people along the way. Thank you.</font><br></p>
