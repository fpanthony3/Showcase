<!--Autobiograghy--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
								
								<p style="margin: 12px; text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"><font size="3">I spent my school ages in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania where I graduated high school in 1990. 
								Miraculously on time. I did not excel in school or appreciate its value until May of 1993 when I re-entered the education system. 
								I then graduated Lincoln Technical Institute with an Associate in Specialized Technology, which is just a fancy description for electronics, 
								15 months later in August of 1994. 
								I also attended Albright College some years later in 2003 in pursuit of a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. 
								Life took an interesting turn and I couldn't finish, however I never stop educating myself. 
								The internet is a wonderful resource. </font><br></p>

								<p style="margin: 12px; text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"><font size="3">After I obtained my Associate degree I have had the pleasure of working for some top notch cutting edge technology companies. 
								Just to name a couple, Comwave designed, developed, and manufactured transmitters, amplifiers, and modulator modules for cable television. 
								They got bought by Comcast who was only interested in the product. 
								I was then employed at Lucent Technologies where I worked on the Laser 2000 line products of the Optoelectronics division, 
								which is to say I built fiber optic lasers that make the internet so fast. 
								They spun us off to become Agere Systems and Agere was eventually sold to Tri-quint. Are you noticing a pattern? Me too. </font><br></p>

								<p style="margin: 12px; text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"><font size="3">Since I can remember I have always driven by my creative side. I have all kinds of interesting hobbies. 
								I've done woodwork, leatherwork, music, and a strange variety of other things. 
								As I would be involved in the creative process I always wondered what people would think of my creation. 
								Would they enjoy them as much as I enjoyed creating them? That thought always drove me to want my own business. 
								I have had several side line business since I've been 12 years old, Yes all legal :-)! 
								Some were moderately successful, nothing I could live on, and some failures. In the end they didn't quite work out. 
								Maybe they weren't quite the business I wanted or I reached a point where my own personal resources ran out and I had to make a decision. 
								The I met the group of guys known today as Solar Storm Studios, llc. 
								I knew that this was my one best chance I could ever ask for, the right mix of talent, motivation, 
								and personality drew me to create the business I always wanted. 
								And now thanks to them and you, the fans, I am CEO of Solar Storm Studios, llc. Thank you for your patronage. </font><br></p>
