							 WEEK OF JUNE 13, 2011:</b></font></font><br><br>
					 					 <font size="3"><font color="gainsboro">
					 					 We meet for the first time. 
					 					 We had no idea what our meeting meant or what it would eventually culminate to. 
					 					 We were just there to do a job and work together on it.</font></font></p><br>

							 WEEK OF JUNE 27, 2011:</b></font></font><br><br>
										 <font size="3"><font color="gainsboro">
										 An off the wall conversation one night at work eventually led to a thought. 
										 I expressed the idea of creating an icon to be built on Daves 3D printer that was pocket size and sold as a commodity. 
										 I filled him in on the cartoon that popped into my head for an advertising plot.										 
										 He bought into it. Mate said he could do the drawing and animation. 
										 He offered Nikki up to do the music and sound effects. I decided I better call Nikki over and ask, he agreed.  
										 Our main Character was now born, and our plan was hatched.</font></font></p><br>

							 WEEK OF JULY 11, 2011:</b></font></font><br><br>
										 <font size="3"><font color="gainsboro">
										 We were thinking that the icon idea was a bit cumbersome and would eventually seem like too much work and not enough fun. 
										 So being the Tech geek that Dave is he suggested a game for the iPhone. We all agreed we would have much more fun doing that. 
										 We went straight to work</font></font></p><br>

							 WEEK OF AUGUST 1, 2011:</b></font></font><br><br>
										 <font size="3"><font color="gainsboro">
										 Which game is to be our first? 
										 Over the last couple weeks we were geared toward a side scrolling game to include our character based on the cartoon.
										  We decided that was a lot to take on due to artwork and coding. 
											In order to get familiar with the coding, and the programs we needed to do the artwork, we would start a little smaller. 
											We started our work again.</font></font></p><br>

							 WEEK OF AUGUST 22, 2011:</b></font></font><br><br>
										 <font size="3"><font color="gainsboro">
										 We were starting to generate a lot of materiel, ideas, and invested hours. 
										 We decided we should make it a little more official and pick a name for the company we seem to be forming. 
										 The first few names we thought of were taken, and some of the others we really did not like. 
										 Finally I thought of Solar Storm Studios and we all liked it. It is official!</font></font></p><br>

							 SEPTEMBER 30, 2011:</b></font></font><br><br>
										 <font size="3"><font color="gainsboro">
										 We acquire our last and final partner, Daves brother Greg. 
										 At the suggestion of Dave we agreed to let him start pitching Greg to join us. 
										 Finally, after many weeks of not getting an answer because the conversation did not seem to be happening, 
										 I cornered Greg myself and got a solid YES. The rest shall we say is company history.</font></font></p><br>

							 OCTOBER 15, 2011:</b></font></font><br><br>
										 <font size="3"><font color="gainsboro">
										 We have our first official meeting. It was exciting! 
										 We discussed a lot of things pertaining to the business end of it. Good solid decisions were made and we had a plan. 
										 Everyone was given a direction to start on. 
										 Especially poor Mate, it was voted that we would abandon the 2D look and go straight for the 3D artwork. 
										 He took it gracefully. Actually he was pretty excited. He wanted to do it 3D from the get-go.</font></font></p><br>

										 <font size="3"><font color="gainsboro">
										 Amanda joins our ranks as an Executive Assistant. She did not seem a bit interested in our project at first. 
										 In fact she expressed deep distaste for it. 
										 So I was picking on her one morning and I said "Why don't you come to the meeting on November 12?". 
										 Much to my surprise and delight she said yes. Well let us just say I am glad, she has been a huge help to us. 
										 We also discussed and finalized the flow of our games. Now we can focus better.</font></font></p><br>

										 Our third monthly meeting. Some deadlines and goals were set to give us better focus. 
										 Aiming to bring a first run beta test by the end of January with the complete game going into beta testing by the end of February. 
										 We also set goals to get our website and social media created and public by the end of December. Wish us luck!</font></font></p><br>
