<!--p class="p3">Our partnership with Emerald Energy also creates a unique opportunity with the Megaflora, a hybrid of the Paulownia tree. 
Retaining the qualities of the fast growth rate and re-growing from its own roots, the Megaflora offers yet a harder wood for lumber. 
Its ability to survive the toughest conditions allows it to be used for soil remediation and reforestation programs worldwide.
